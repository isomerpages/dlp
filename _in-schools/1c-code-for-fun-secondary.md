|Carolina|Micro:bit|Makecode|Carolina Code for Fun engages student with Technology to offer solutions related to current Global Crises. <br>Computational thinking and design thinking concepts are introduced and taught through mini projects. Using Microbit and knowledge learnt in Block Base programming, students shall build a prototype that will address a Problem Statement related to Climate Change and Global Warming. <br>Notably, they are also introduced to IoT (Internet of Things) and how IoT and Microbit can be incorporated together to improve the lives of the people.AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also introduced whereby students learn to build a Chat Bot.|For the final project, students will amalgamate their learning and hand on skills by designing and building a prototype related  to climate change and global warming.|         |
