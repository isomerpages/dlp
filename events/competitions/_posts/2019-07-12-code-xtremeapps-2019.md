The CXA hackathon is back this year to challenge minds and inspire innovative solutions for current issues that affect us. This year’s theme is “Digital Transformation for a Better World”, and the focus is on improving the sustainability of the world we live in with new innovative and transformative digital solutions.

Similarly to previous year’s competition, the challenge statements will be released 6 weeks before the competition by the CXA Organizing Committee, with an additional twist to each challenge to be revealed just before the start of the 24-hour challenge.

CXA has 3 main tracks – 24-hour School and Open Categories, as well as a 3-hour Junior Category.

The venue of the hackathon will be held at Singapore Management University (SMU) at the School of Economics/Social Sciences and it will take place over a period of 2 days from 12-13 July 2019.


The following are the list of organizers for this competition.
