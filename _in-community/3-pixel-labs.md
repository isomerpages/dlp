#### Explore the world of digital fabrication with MakeIT at Libraries, a joint initiative by NLB and IMDA, that aims to encourage Making using Tech.

![pixel labs image1](/images/in-community/overview/pixel-labs-image2copy.jpg)

**Discover digital making at MakeIT, our library makerspaces.**

Formerly known as PIXEL Labs@NLB, the renamed MakeIT at Libraries offer library users a dedicated space with tools, equipment, and hardware kits that enable individuals to Learn, Tinker and Create, in both digital and traditional fabrication.<br>

Learn how creativity and innovation is supported by emerging fabrication tech such as 3D printing and Robotics, and why such skills are a key gateway for 21st century skills such as problem solving, and design thinking.<br>

Programmes and activities are jointly arranged by NLB and IMDA, covering both tech and non-tech areas such as hands-on workshops across 5 signature areas. The curriculum emphasizes heavy hands-on tinkering and learn-by-doing and is aimed at everyone from Secondary school students to Seniors.<br>

**MakeIT Signature Areas**

MakeIT aims to introduce Making and Innovation to the general public by way of 5 areas:<br><br>

1. 3D Printing
*Introduces additive manufacturing as a rapid, reliable method to craft, create and prototype. Curriculum covers foundational understanding of this method of fabrication, 3D modelling, and hands-on usage of Printers using PLA filament material.<br>
