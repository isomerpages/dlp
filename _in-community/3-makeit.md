### Explore the world of digital fabrication with MakeIT at Libraries, a joint initiative by NLB and IMDA, that aims to encourage Making using Tech.

![pixel labs image1](/images/in-community/overview/pixel-labs-image2copy.jpg)

#### Discover digital making at MakeIT, our library makerspaces.

Formerly known as PIXEL Labs@NLB, the renamed MakeIT at Libraries offer library users a dedicated space with tools, equipment, and hardware kits that enable individuals to Learn, Tinker and Create, in both digital and traditional fabrication.<br>

Learn how creativity and innovation is supported by emerging fabrication tech such as 3D printing and Robotics, and why such skills are a key gateway for 21st century skills such as problem solving, and design thinking.<br>

Programmes and activities are jointly arranged by NLB and IMDA, covering both tech and non-tech areas such as hands-on workshops across 5 signature areas. The curriculum emphasizes heavy hands-on tinkering and learn-by-doing and is aimed at everyone from Secondary school students to Seniors.<br>

#### MakeIT Signature Areas

MakeIT aims to introduce Making and Innovation to the general public by way of 5 areas:<br>
1. 3D Printing
  * Introduces additive manufacturing as a rapid, reliable method to craft, create and prototype. Curriculum covers foundational understanding of this method of fabrication, 3D modelling, and hands-on usage of Printers using PLA filament material.<br>

2. Robotics & Coding
  * Explore the world of coding for robotics and microcontrollers. Curriculum is available for Micro:bit and Arduino platforms, with supporting robotic kits that allow in-person trial and testing.
  
 3. Upcycling
   * MakeIT aims to grow awareness of sustainable innovation and creation, and encourages Making with upcycling in mind. Topics available include repair and home-hacks, and lo-fi prototyping.
   
 4. Sewing 
  * No longer solely the domain of auntie seamstresses, sewing goes back to its roots in material reinforcement and binary weaving, to bring new light to modern day digital fabrication and use of materials. Classes offered include traditional techniques as well as integration of tech, such as wearables and conductive materials. 
 
 5. Lasercutting (coming soon)
   * The public will be introduced to the lasercutting machine, which uses compuetrised commands to accurately cut flat materials. Lasercut can be used for prototyping, craft and engineering.<br>

**Tinkering**

To promote self-learning and learning-by-doing, MakeIT welcomes members of the public to do on-site tinkering at the makerspaces. Workspace, tools, and equipment such as laptops, 3D printers, robotic kits and sewing machines are available at no cost for use.<br> 

For more information on accessing these services, please visit any of the core branches of MakeIT, and request to speak to the Centre Manager.<br>

**Learning Journeys**

MakeIT welcomes schools, educators and corporates to come and learn more about Making and Makerspaces. Regular learning journeys are available throughout the year. 
Parties interested to request for a learning journey for their organization may do so at this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/makeit-learningjourney" target="_blank">link</a>.<br>

*Some services may not be currently available due to COVID safety measures.*
