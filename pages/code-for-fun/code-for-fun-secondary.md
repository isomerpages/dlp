#### The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme for Secondary Schools complements existing MOE Computing Education efforts in secondary schools, such as the Computing-related Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) as well as the O-Level (elective) Computing subjects. The programme offers a 10-hour curriculum which

-	focuses on computational thinking concepts including their application in the real world and in coding;
-	incorporates elements of making and design prototyping through the use of microcontrollers; and
-	reinforces students’ understanding through exposure to practical project work.

Two programming tracks, namely, Block-based programming and Text-based programming, will be available under the programme.

IMDA and MOE HQ will fully fund the training cost of 1 lower secondary school cohort (i.e. either Secondary 1 or Secondary 2) per year. Participating secondary schools will also be fully funded for the required supporting microcontrollers and accessories, subject to terms and conditions. 

**Application Details**

1.	Please refer to the details provided in the Programme Booklet disseminated to all MOE Government & Government-Aided Secondary Schools.
2.	Please select your preferred course and contact the training partner (provided in the list below) to confirm their availability to provide the required training on your scheduled training dates.
3.	Please submit your school’s application online via Forms.SG during the application period from XX Jan 2021 to 26 Mar 2021.
4.	IMDA and MOE HQ will review your school’s application and provide an approval notice to commence training.
5.	Schools can only commence training after receiving the written approval from IMDA and MOE HQ.
