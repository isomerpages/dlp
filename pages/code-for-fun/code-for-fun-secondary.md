Using Microbit and knowledge learnt in Block Base programming, students shall build a prototype that will address a Problem Statement related to Climate Change and Global Warming. <br><br>Notably, they are also introduced to IoT (Internet of Things) and how IoT and Microbit can be incorporated together to improve the lives of the people. <br><br>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is also introduced whereby students learn to build a Chat Bot.|For the final project, students will amalgamate their learning and hand on skills by designing and building a prototype related to climate change and global warming.<br><br>1.

Air pollution is not limited to just haze, but there are also other causes through the exhaust emission and factory fumes.<br><br>All these factors have led to climate change and students will need to think of a solution, build and code out a prototype using a proposed set to address the situation and present their solutions to the class at the end of the session.|
